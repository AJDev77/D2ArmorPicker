      This tool allows you to select the optimal armor from your inventory and vault to satisfy your stat needs.
      It also tells you which stat mods you have to use!

      You have to log in to enable this tool to grab your armor from the API.<br/>

      D2ArmorPicker is developed for Chromium based browsers. It may have some problems with Safari, as that browser does not support WebWorkers as it should.
